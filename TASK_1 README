# Iris Flower Classification

Explore various classification models for the Iris flower dataset, a popular machine learning dataset used to practice classification techniques.

## Introduction

The Iris dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The goal is to classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on these feature measurements.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost

## Results

All models achieved 100% accuracy on the Iris dataset, demonstrating their effectiveness in distinguishing Iris flower species based on their features.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and results.

## Future Considerations

In real-world scenarios, datasets can be noisier, and model performance may vary. This project serves as a starting point for understanding classification techniques and their application to the Iris dataset.
